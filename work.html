            <h2>Amazon</h2><h3>Software Developer Engineer Intern</h3> 
            <h4>Created a full-stack internal ops tool that retrieved details for and allowed for creation/acceptance of amendment
            requests for buyer-seller agreements in AWS marketplace to greatly reduce load for on-call engineers.
            Worked with API Gateway, Lambda, AWS CDK, DynamoDB, IAM roles, and user authorization to create an API
            and backend that automated agreement request detail retrieval, making a process that previously required manually
            browsing the database as well as team-specific credentials take a matter of seconds.
            Added Cloudwatch graph metrics that displayed transactions per second, error rate, and latency to measure
            Lambda function performance and automatically create SEV3 tickets in case of abnormal metrics.
            Created comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure reliability of API and Backend as well as deploying
            integration tests into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure future changes aren’t liabilities to the tool’s functionality.</h4>

                Created a math practice website that adapted to different skills and weaknesses as the user completed questions, as
                well as learning and using the Hasura database service to send information from the backend to the website.
